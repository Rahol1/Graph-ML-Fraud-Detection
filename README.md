# Graph-ML-Fraud-Detection

In this project, we aim to detect fraudulent behavior in bank transactions using graph databases and machine learning models.
The dataset used for this project is the BankSim dataset which is a simulated dataset created using a sample of transactional data provided by a bank in Spain (https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/banksim1).
